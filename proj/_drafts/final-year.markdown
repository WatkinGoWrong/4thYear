<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="TREE.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 500px;"/>
</div>

- Comparing two trees (Students against Teachers) and returning a Grade depending on similarities.

- If differences are present the Students Tree will be drawn differently to highlight these differences for learning purposes. i.e A dotted line instead of a whole line

- The end product will be an API that returns JSON consisting of the grade & tree structure for each student.
