#Neonicotinoids

Incesticides - definition

Seed coat - foliar spray
 - dissovled into soil
 - root uptake
 - Travels whole way through the plant

Three Main ones
 - imidacloprid
 - Clothianidin
 - Thiamethoxan

aphids - nAChR

side effects
- paralysis
- tremors/shaking
- vommiting
- death

---

#EU - 1

May 2013
- Eu commission
- ban Neonicotinoids use
- expect greenhouses and winter crops
- Starting 1st Dec 2013

2008
- EFSA , took info from 22 countries in europe
- merged info to get general outlook of active substances.
- Survailence programmes and honey production per country.

2003
- colony collapse started to be found

---

#EU - 2
2007
- 40%-50% bee mortality in Italy
- 11.7% bee mortality in UK (expected 2008 over 24.2% mortality rate)

(need to read paper on 2008 ^ )

2016
- EFSA confirmed Neonicotinoids by foliar spray are risk to Bees
- Update risk to bees to be expected in Feb 2018

#Bees

Most economic valuable pollinator for crop production
- can be bought coommercially (greenhouse pollination)  
- small in size and limited requirements (easy to maintain)

Hive
- One Queen (responsible for repopulating the hide)
- Adult worker Bees devided into young stay in the hive (cleaning, protection, temp control) Older bees forage for food

distinction between young and old can change due to requirements of each roles in the hive

#CCD

#Stress Factors

Consist of:
- pesticides
- diseases
- microbal agents
- habitat alterations or loss

Equals colony stresses:
- decreased egg laying
- develop times alterated (age bracket - young/old)
- Mortality increase
- Hive protection decreased

All of these cause the Hive to decrease in size, and a small impact could effect the overall outcome of the hive

#Fungi Nesoma & Pesticide Imidacloprid

Alaux et al (2010)
- Nesoma hosts nutrients inside the body.
- Apis mellifera higher mortality when exposed to both then independently
- Imidacloprid can produce spore germination inhabitation (control > Imidacloprid spore count)

Alburki et al (2010)
- 32 hives used
- Thiamethoxan corn seed coat causes more BQCV and varroa mites
- BQCV is a RNA virus. Effects the developing queen larva and eggs
- Can be stored in Hive combs introduced to bee gut via food intake
- 3 colonies died, 2 from treated equals deformed wings symptoms less eggs found in hive.
- Control failure to re-queen. No symptoms found, indicating that Thiamethoxan is the cause

#Excess Neonicotinoids vs Insects

Less than 20% of Neonicotinoids absorbed by target plant.

Excess in soil absorbed by neighbouring crops and wild flowers.

Non target insects exposed, ie Butterflies, Moths, Wasps

#Butterflies

England 2015 Gilbern et al
- 17 common spieces
- Average decline of 58% (2000-2009)

1985-1998 : Pre Neonicotinoids

1999-2000 : Post Neonicotinoids (bigger decline shown)

Comma + 34%

Essex slipper minus 67%

Scotland Neonicotinoids low, butterflies no decline

---

Foster et al (2016) Lowland north California
- decrease in butterflies since 1997
- Neonicotinoids introduced in 1995
- 67 spieces observed

Concluded
- Neonicotinoids caused small bodies (insufficent growth)
- Fewer generations per year (hence population decline)

---

Mexico 2014/15 over wintering
- Thogmartin et al 2017
- Monarch - 84%

Midwest USA
- Pecenka and Lundgren 2015
- Monarch - 81%
- Milkweed - 58%
- Contamination of Clothianidin
- Eggs layed on contaminated Milkweed:
- Increased Development time
- +1ppb = head capsule width reduced in size
- +5ppb = body length of larva affected
- 20-50% of eggs in test field survived post hatching
- 36 hour post exposure sub lethal dose
- lc10 = 7.72ppb, lc50 = 15.63ppb, lc90 = 30.70ppb

Backs up Gilbern et al idea eggs layed on oil seed rape contaiminated with Neonicotinoids = adverse effects (2015)
